Armagedon

His palms spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti
There's vomit on his sweater spaghetti, his spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti to drop bombs,
But he keeps on spaghetti what he wrote down,
The whole crowd goes spaghetti
He opens his mouth, but spaghetti won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
Spaghetti run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to spaghetti, Oh there goes spaghetti
Oh, there goes spaghetti, bloah
He's so mad, but he won't give up spaghetti, no.
He won't have it, he knows he keeps on forgetting
That his spaghetti's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his spaghetti, that's when it's
Back to the lab again!
